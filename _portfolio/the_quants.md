## What it's about
A wonderful introduction to the culture of quantitative trading on Wall Street, Scott Patterson's, The Quants, takes a personal approach when chronicling events from the late 20th century up to and including the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009.

Focusing primarily on the narrative surrounding events involving and affecting notable quants such as Peter Muller, Ken Griffin, Cliff Asness, Boaz Weinstein, Jim Simons, Ed Thorp, and Aaron Brown, The Quants tells the story of the evolution of modern computational quantitative finance.  While The Quants presents such an evolution from the perspectives of each of these iconoclasts, Patterson still retains an independent, third-person-omniscient point of view--importantly leaving the discussion of the factors leading to the Global Financial Crisis generally unbiased.

In contrast to what the book's subtitle may suggest, The Quants is not largely an indictment of quantitative trading, though the concept of greedy (in Patterson's mind) financial engineering in the forms of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and subprime mortgage backed securities (MBS) is a thesis presented at the end of the book.  Nevertheless, Patterson's first book on quantitative finance offers a relatively balanced, largely informative characterization of the modern leaders in finance without morphing into an accusatory slam of quantitative trading and analysis.
