Welcome to my personal homepage! Herein, I collect my thoughts on and interpretations of concepts about which I am passionate. Forcing myself to articulate such mental threads reinforces the respective thought processes that enabled conceptual lucidity in the first place. Put simply, explaining material through writing and teaching is an excellent mechanism for deepening one's own understanding of the concepts taught. Plus, sharing my work with others is fun!

From my views on mathematics, finance, computer science, and programming to my ruminations on the books I've read, I've designed this website as a collection to be shared. Respectful, responsible use of the content that I post is encouraged, as long as proper attribution is provided (i.e., don't forget to cite me!). I hope that you enjoy consuming my content as much as I enjoy creating it.
