## My approach to reading
Reading spurs thought, allowing the engaged participant to experience the intellectual journeys undergone in the minds of great authors and great thinkers. Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, largely because of the thoughts it facilitates. To crystalize the thoughts generated by reading, I provide brief synopses of some of the books that I've recently enjoyed. My intent is to create a log that I can refer to when revisiting the lessons learned in previously-read material. Hopefully, my analyses make it easier for you to shape your reading list, and ideally, after you read some of these books, comparing your central takeaways with mine enrichens your learning.
